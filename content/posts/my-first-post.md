# Big O Notation
# Begin

Hello everybody and welcome back. My name is Artem and blog post we're going to understand what does Big O notation mean and consider the time complexity. So, Let's get to it!

## Agenda:
- Why it's essential to understand and master Big O?
- Big O definition
- Big O explanation with example
- Types of Big O and simple examples
- Considerations


## Why it's essential to understand and master Big O?
- First, it allows you to determine the most efficient solution for task that you need to resolve.
- Secondly, it potentially could help you to optimise an existing solution that you have implemented already. 
- Finally, most likely that you'll not pass a coding interview without mastering this topic.


# Big O definition
**Big O time** is the language and metric that describes the efficiency of algorithms.
Or to be more precise **the way to describe how long algorithm performs as it's input size growth.**  


# Big O explanation with an example
with liner complexity

```go
// The program finds the maximum element in the list
package main

import "fmt"

func main(){
	numbers := []int{1, 10, 13, 3, 20, 132, 123123}
	max, err := getMax(numbers)
	fmt.Println("max number in the slice is:", max)
	fmt.Println("err:", err)
}

func getMax(numbers []int) (int, error) {
	if len(numbers) == 0 {
		return 0, fmt.Errorf("received an empty slice")
	}
	max := numbers[0]
	for _, n := range numbers {
		if n > max {
			max = n
		}
	}
	return max, nil
}
```

On this example we can see the linear complexity



# Considerations

- When we have something which is not nested in the loop, then we summarise the complexity.
- When we calculate big o we usually remove all of the constants
- When we have something which is nested in the loop, then we multiply the complexity.
- Complexity for each input is calculated separately if they don't have the same length.
- Drop the less significant terms.
